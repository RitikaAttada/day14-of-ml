## ðŸŒŸ **Day 14: Multivariate Linear Regression**

Today, I worked on five structured regression problems involving **multiple input features** that influence a single target value (`Exam_Score`). Each dataset represented different student performance scenarios with the following features:


## ðŸ§  **What I Did**

âœ… Created 5 multivariate regression datasets with realistic and meaningful features
âœ… Trained a Linear Regression model on each dataset

---

## ðŸ§­ **Next Steps**

* Try using **RÂ² Score, MAE, and MSE** for model evaluation
* Test **overfitting/underfitting** using larger or smaller datasets
* Introduce **Polynomial Features** for nonlinear effects
* Experiment with **Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)** on these datasets
